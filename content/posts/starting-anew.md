Normally people do this kind of thing on their new year's resolutions, but since I do not like
to postpone things here I am, starting a new blog from the ashes of the previous one. But why?

Well it's quite simple, I've noticed a certain pattern that keeps emerging in the things I personally
do. When I have an idea, i.e. a blog, I tend to prototype something simple but functional, then
I iterate over the base idea to add more functionalities to it, and then when everything is working,
instead of using it to serve the purpose it was built for, I take an entirely different path and try to
make it even more perfect, by either revamping the whole user interface or *the thing that happened
this time*, trying to build a fully fledged static site generator to post my shit. Yeah, I'm quite a 
DIY guy. But the problem does not reside in the idea of making a static site generator, nope,  the thing 
is that I subconsciously see the thing that I just created as something incomplete, and my focus shifts 
entirely into creating that static site generator. I bet you can see the problem now, the feat that I 
was trying to accomplish is not something that you do in a weekend, unless you're ThePrimeagen. So I've 
decided to still do that project because it's a topic I'm interested in, but I will shove my perfectionism
up my arse and use [hugo](https://gohugo.io), which in all honesty it's mind-blowingly great, to keep 
throwing content out.

From now on you can expect one article per week, all related to programming, and since I want to use
this blog as a way to learn new stuff, many of the posts that you'll find will be related to weekend
projects that I have built, tech that I want to try out, or when I feel a bit philosophical, my point
of view about a certain topic.

Thank you for your time, ksrof out.
